# SIMULATION-EXPERIMENTS

# AIM : To Design and simulate the following experiments using LT-Spice.
1.Inverting,Non-Inverting and Differential Amplifier
2.Instrumentation amplifier
3.Low-Pass,High-Pass and Band Pass Filter using op-amp 741.
4.R-2R Ladder Digital to Analog Converter.

# SOFTWARE REQUIRED: LT-Spice

# PROCEDURE:
• Double click on LT-Spice icon.
• New schematic window open.
• Pick and paste the required component from the library and draw the circuit diagram .
• Complete the connection.
• Save the file by giving file name.
• Click on the run option ->click advanced open ->select Ac analysis->enter the amplitude time delay stop time value.
• Click on the run option ->simulation window opens->place the probe ->output graph is obtained.
